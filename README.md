# App Icon Tools 🛠️

> The project is currently abandoned. Features that are already present should work without a problem, in downloadable releases, but no further support or development will be made here. I haven't updated the website hosting either.

## Description

This multiplatform app is **powered by Flutter** and was created for simple and intuitive preview and generation of (launcher/desktop) app icons, for the most popular operating systems. It doesn't contain tracking or any advertising and is available for free as an open-source. PRs, suggestions, translations, etc. – are welcome!

## Key Features

Here are some of the unique features of this application:

* It creates icons not only for Android and iOS but for **all platforms that Flutter supports** (at the moment, the Linux platform from Flutter does not have an app icon, but once the Flutter team fixes [this issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/53229), everything is ready).
* It **works locally** (even in PWA form) on your device and **does not send your files to any servers**.
* It will **find and show you the issues that can cause you problems** with displaying or app Stores refusal.
* It can **show icons in different shapes** and **safety zone** masks.
* It can exclusively **preview the parallax animation of adaptive Android icons** since the website for their testing [adapticon.tooo.io](https://adapticon.tooo.io) is gone.
* It **shows the icons as they would look on real devices**, and all devices here are not just photos, but vector images — ready for 16K.
* It **generates icons not destructive way** — all you get is an archive, the contents of which you can check before you overwrite your files.
* For additional information, it will **forward you to a website with official documentation** for each platform.
* It **works natively on all platforms** that Flutter supports.
* The project **supports multiple languages**, and you can easily add your own.
* This app is made for both developers and designers, and in the end, the generated icons can be used not only for Flutter applications. Just give it a try!


## Releases

You can find binaries for **Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and PWA** in the [Releases](https://github.com/tsinis/app_icon_tools/releases) section of this GitHub repository.
